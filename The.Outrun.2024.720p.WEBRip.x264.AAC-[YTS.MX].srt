is kind of changing the world.

about doing

is studying seaweed farming.

1451
01:40:22,517 --> 01:40:24,101
So, I started to look into it

1452
01:40:24,102 --> 01:40:26,770
and there's all these
different benefits to seaweed.

1453
01:40:26,771 --> 01:40:30,107
There's, you know,
soil fertilizers.

1454
01:40:30,108 --> 01:40:31,942
If you feed it to cows,
it's a really great way,

1455
01:40:31,943 --> 01:40:34,278
a great natural way
to fertilize the soil.

1456
01:40:34,279 --> 01:40:36,238
The cattle produce less methane

1457
01:40:36,239 --> 01:40:37,906
when they burp
and when they fart.

1458
01:40:37,907 --> 01:40:39,783
And, you know,
it supplies your body

1459
01:40:39,784 --> 01:40:43,328
with magnesium, copper,
all these different things.

1460
01:40:43,329 --> 01:40:46,582
It also supplies the earth
with 60% of its oxygen.

1461
01:40:46,583 --> 01:40:48,167

that was the rainforest.

but it's marine plants.
